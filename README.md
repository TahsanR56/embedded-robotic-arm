# embedded-robotic-arm
A low-cost robotic arm built to explore embedded systems, servo control, and progressive complexity from Arduino to ESP32.

## Project Overview
This is a C++/Arduino based robotic arm that that uses servos and is able to rotate, bend,  pick up and put down items. This project is split into different phases:

- **Phase 1**: A low cost prototype made with cardboard, controlled with buttons
- **Phase 2**: A more polished robotic arm that has custom 3d printed arms, and is controlled with a joystick. It will have similar logic but use an ESP32 microcontoller and PID algorithms
