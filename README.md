# embedded-robotic-arm
A low-cost robotic arm built to explore embedded systems, servo control, and control algorithms.
---

## Project Overview
This is a C++/Arduino based robotic arm that that uses servos and is able to rotate, bend,  pick up and put down items. This project is split into different phases:

- **Phase 1**: A low cost prototype made with cardboard, controlled with potentiometers
- **Phase 2**: A more polished robotic arm that has custom 3d printed arms, and is controlled with a GUI

## Development Log

| Date       | Update Summary                                  |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 2025-06-18 | I have printed and assembled all components except for the gripper, uploaded my wave script to the arm. Watch the demo [here](https://youtube.com/shorts/mAFQgBKIPcE?feature=share)|
| 2025-06-17 | I have started printing using my universities 3d printers, 3/6 parts completed. Programmed a wave animation whilst waiting
| 2025-06-17 | I have completed my models for the each joint and will begin the printing process
| 2025-06-14 | I have been busy with other commitments but I have returned to this project, I have started to 3D model my components in Fusion and have made a few joints. Watch the cad demo video [here](https://youtu.be/NGLektZBveY)|
| 2025-05-27 | Built the cardboard robotic arm prototype with code and manual controls. Photos are uploaded. Watch the movement demo video here [here](https://youtu.be/dCFzufIIIDc), and a demo of the arm bringing me a waterbottle [here](https://youtube.com/shorts/pW1OAWMeoAk)|
| 2025-05-16 | Tested external power and multi-servo control via single potentiometer. Watch the demo video [here](https://youtube.com/shorts/bfpbie02di8?feature=share) |
| 2025-05-15 | Initial setup of servo control code and potentiometer reading |
| 2025-05-14 | Begun cutting cardboard prototype|
| 2025-05-13 | Began creating 3d models with fusion360|
